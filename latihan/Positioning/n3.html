  <h3>
  	3. position:absolute
  </h3>
<p>
When you specify position:absolute, the element is removed from the document and placed exactly where you tell it to go.
</p>

<p>
Let's move div-1a to the top right of the page:
</p>
</div>
<div class="container" id="pre1">

<pre>
 #div-1a {
 position:absolute;
 top:0;
 right:0;
 width:200px;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <h1></h1>
<p>
Notice that this time, since div-1a was removed from the document, the other elements on the page were positioned differently: div-1b, div-1c, and div-after moved up since div-1a was no longer there.
</p>

<p>
Also notice that div-1a was positioned in the top right corner of the page. It's nice to be able to position things directly the page, but it's of limited value.
</p>
<p>
	What I really want is to position div-1a relative to div-1. And that's where relative position comes back into play.

  Footnotes
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	There is a bug in the Windows IE browser: if you specify a relative width (like "width:50%") then the width will be based on the parent element instead of on the positioning element.
	</li>
</ul>
