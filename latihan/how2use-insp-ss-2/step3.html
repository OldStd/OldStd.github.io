<p>In the previoud screen we see the headings h1, h2, through h6 lining up vertically.</p>

<p>we can change them to line up horizontally by applying</p>
<p>display: inline-block;</p>
<p>and give a bit of spacing between them</p>
<p>by applying padding: 10px;</p>

<p>All these heading h1 through h6 were given a common class of hx.</p>

<p>If we click on the line of h1 class hx we see an item h1.hx</p>

<p>To get the styling for the class of hx</p>
<p>We simply change the item h1.hx to .hx</p>
<p>and then apply our styling as follows:</p>

<pre>
.hx {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 10px;
}	
</pre>

<p>We can see the desired result as shown in the right pane</p>
