<h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
<p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
<p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
<p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
<p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<liHTML/DOM manipulation</li>
	<li>CSS manipulation</li>
	<li>HTML event methods</li>
	<li>Effects and animations</li>
	<li>AJAX</li>
	<li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>
<h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
<p>There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.
</p>
<p>Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google</li>
	<li>Microsoft</li>
	<li>IBM</li>
	<li>Netflix</li>
</ul>

<h2>Will jQuery work in all browsers?</h2>
