  <h3>
    Exercises based on class 20160928
  </h3>
<p>
  This project is based on class taken on 28 Sep 2016.
</p>

<p>
  The notes and CSS codes used in this exercise are copied from the web site on "Learn CSS positioning in ten steps".
</p>
<p>
  http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/
</p>
<p>
  However, the webpage displays on the right-hand side are exercises based on the notes and CSS scripts given by the author from that website.
</p>
<p>
   The displays in the right-pane show the results of applying the CSS styling to the various &lt;div&gt; elements.
</p>
<p>Because I am using an external css stylesheet, the format and reference of the css styles are slightly modified from those given by the author:</p>
</div>
<div class="container" id="pre1">

<pre>
 For example:
 #div-1 {
 position:static;
}
becomes
div#wd1-div-1 {
 position:static;
}
where wd1 is
the name of
webpage display 1
</pre>
</div>

</body>
</html>
