<p>The codes copied and pasted into the sublime-text file:</p>
<pre>
div#container {
    width: 912px;
    height: 912px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    background-color: coral;
}	
</pre>
<p>The web-page now has a red square looking like that shown on the right pane.</p>
<p>We have used the Google-developer tool to set some of the css styles for the container in this application.</p>
<p>Namely, we have set the width, height, and border of the container</p>
<p>and copy the css codes to our sublime-text file</p>
<p>The results are shown in the web-page, each step as we go through the exercise.</p>
<p>As they say, what you see is what you get</p>
